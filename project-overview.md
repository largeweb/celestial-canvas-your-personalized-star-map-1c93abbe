# Project Overview

Project Name: Celestial Canvas: Your Personalized Star Map

Description: Celestial Canvas is a web application that generates a custom star map, simulating the celestial events visible from a user-selected location and date. While the astronomical data and mapping calculations are mocked for this prototype, the application aims to provide a visually stunning and engaging experience, allowing users to plan "stargazing events" or commemorate "astronomical anniversaries."

Key Features:

*   Personalized Star Map Generation: Users enter their location (via city/region selection or lat/long coordinates) and a date. The app then displays a visually appealing star map, simulating the positions of major stars, constellations, and planets visible from that location on that date.
*   Visual Style Options: Users can choose from several visual styles for their star map:
    *   Minimalist: A clean, uncluttered map with only the brightest stars and constellation outlines.
    *   Realistic: An attempt to simulate the appearance of the night sky, including atmospheric effects and light pollution.
    *   Interactive: A map that allows users to click on celestial objects to learn more (mock data, of course!).
*   Customizable Mock Settings:
    *   Light Pollution Level: Users can adjust the simulated light pollution to see how it affects the visibility of stars.
    *   Telescope Type: A purely aesthetic setting, allowing users to "view" the sky through different simulated telescopes (e.g., binoculars, small telescope, large telescope).
*   Subscription-Based Model: (Mocked)
    *   Free Tier: Access to basic star maps with limited customization options.
    *   Premium Tier: Unlocks all visual styles, customization settings, and the ability to save and share generated star maps.

Technology Stack:

*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.

Overall Goal: To create a beautiful and engaging frontend experience that showcases the potential of a personalized planetarium app.
